# Data-Visualization-on-Human-Acrtvity-Recogniton
Data visualization on UCI Human Activity Recognition system



This project is a Python Jupyter notebook that uses the UCI HAR dataset to apply machine learning algorithms. The dataset contains sensor data obtained from smartphones worn by test subjects while performing various activities, such as walking, sitting, and standing. The notebook implements two machine learning algorithms, random forest, and decision tree, to classify the activities based on the sensor data. The notebook contains code for loading the dataset, reshaping the input data, creating the classifiers, making predictions, and evaluating the performance of the models using accuracy and classification report. The code is well-documented and can serve as a useful resource for anyone interested in working with this dataset or implementing these machine learning algorithms.
